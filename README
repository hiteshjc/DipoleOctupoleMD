This software was written by Anish Bhardwaj for performing Monte Carlo plus Molecular Dynamics 
for the dipole-octupole spin 1/2 model on a pyrochlore lattice. It is based on a C++ code written by Hitesh Changlani 
which does the same calculation but for a dipolar system.

Additional scripts are available on request from Anish Bhardwaj (ab12k@my.fsu.edu).
